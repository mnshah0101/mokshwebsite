              hello! i am moksh shah, a student at georgia tech studying
              computer science with a focus on system architecture and computer
              intelligence. i am deeply interested in making cool software
              products and working with great people. i'm a full stack engineer
              at heart and i love working on building beautiful uis with clean,
              efficient backends. my go-to tech stack consists of react and go,
              but i am always open to learning new technologies.

              right now, i am working on a few projects in the realm of sports
              technology that i'm very excited about, both as a developer and
              equity holder. concurrently, i spend my nights working on a legal
              ai start-up that aims to make e-discovery and document review cost
              effective, especially for small practices.

              since february 2024, i've been working as an engineer and
              technical lead at avalon in berkeley, ca. alongside a talented
              team of three engineers, i've been developing a
              retrieval-augmented generation chatbot tailored for law firms.
              this chatbot automates eDiscovery and drafts motions and briefs by
              leveraging tens of thousands of case files using technologies like
              pinecone, nextjs, dynamodb, typescript, and go. i've also
              spearheaded the creation of a web socket file transfer pipeline to
              aws s3, ensuring efficient downstream feeding into our rag model.
              moreover, i've optimized our language models with langchain to
              assess the probability of case wins, aggregating metrics from
              various documents to enhance decision-making processes.

              i was hired as a machine learning engineer at megalabs, an ai
              venture firm. i, along with four other engineers, created a react
              app using the t3 stack (typescript, trpc, tailwindcss) for a
              sports data conversational assistant. i also built an intelligent
              sql agent with aws bedrock, aws athena, langchain, gpt 4.0, and
              aws open search that could generate and run complex sql queries on
              its own to answer user questions in python. on top of that, i put
              together a mongodb-backed interface to keep tabs on thousands of
              user queries and check how accurate our models were during alpha
              testing.

              our main e-commerce site using the mern stack (mongo, expressjs,
              react, nodejs) from the ground up. integrating the stripe api, i
              set up a system to handle over a dozen products and subscriptions,
              helping us process more than $1,000,000 in payments each year.
              plus, i designed and implemented mysql databases to keep all our
              user and customer info safe.
