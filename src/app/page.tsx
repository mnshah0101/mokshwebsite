                i was hired as a software engineering intern at megalabs, an ai
                venture firm. i was responsible for creating the application
                layer for an ai sports data analyst. the magic is a custom
                text-to-sql engine which takes user questions and automatically
                generates sql queries, which we intelligently debug on the fly.
                i was also responsible for creating the product's rest apis and
                utilized web socket connections for response streaming. we also
                utilized the t3 stack for frontend/backend communication. we are
                in the midst of expanding and fundraising.

              since february 2024, i've been working as an engineer and
              technical lead at avalon in berkeley, ca. alongside a talented
              team of three engineers, i've been developing a
              retrieval-augmented generation chatbot tailored for law firms.
              this chatbot automates eDiscovery and drafts motions and briefs by
              leveraging tens of thousands of case files using technologies like
              pinecone, nextjs, dynamodb, typescript, and go. i've also
              spearheaded the creation of a web socket file transfer pipeline to
              aws s3, ensuring efficient downstream feeding into our rag model.
              moreover, i've optimized our language models with langchain to
              assess the probability of case wins, aggregating metrics from
              various documents to enhance decision-making processes. as a team,
              we sucessfully pitched to various venture capitalists and had a
              couple law firms using our product. we decided put the pause on
              this until we graduate.
